💻 Project: LocalBox Miner
📝 Project Description (Point-Wise with Emojis)

📦 LocalBox Miner is a React-based offline data management application built to demonstrate core React concepts in a practical way.

⚛️ The project focuses on state management using React Hooks (useState, useEffect).

💾 All data is stored locally in the browser using localStorage, making the application fully offline-first.

➕ Users can add new records through a controlled form with validation.

✏️ Existing records can be edited easily, showing real-time state updates.

🗑️ Records can be deleted individually or cleared completely with confirmation.

🔄 Every action (add, edit, delete) instantly updates both the UI and localStorage.

🧱 The project is divided into reusable components for better structure and readability.

🎯 Demonstrates event handling such as onChange, onSubmit, and onClick.

🧠 Shows argument passing in event handlers (e.g., edit/delete by ID).

🎭 Uses conditional rendering to display empty states, edit mode, and validation feedback.

📊 Displays records in a professional table-based dashboard UI.

🎨 Styled with custom CSS to give a clean and professional admin-panel look.

🚫 No backend server or external APIs are used — everything runs inside React.

🧪 Helps beginners understand how real-world dashboards and offline tools are built.

✅ Overall, LocalBox Miner simulates a lightweight admin dashboard and is ideal for learning React fundamentals in a structured and practical manner.
